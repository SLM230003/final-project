# Title
Inverting Digital Rain Turtle Drawing
## Repository
<https://github.com/SLM230003/final-project.git>

## Description
I would like to create a code that is like our last lab which was a generated moving artwork. I plan to do something similar by using drawing with turtles, and perhaps including digital rain like in Lab C08.
## Features
- Feature 1
  - Code that uses turtle drawing to make a design of my choosing
- Feature 2
  - code that makes the digital rain
- Feature N
  - code to invert the colors using the space bar

## Challenges
- A fast way to come up with math to make my drawing because it will be a lot of changing in directions
- maybe a more efficient way of making digital rain but if not I will use the instructions our teacher gave us, but I will add custom changes to fit my liking.
- How to invert colors simultaneously in a given display so it looks uniform.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally I will have a code that when run shows a display of a color of my choosing. That uses a turtle to make a drawing of my choosing. That simultaneously displays custom digital rain of my choosing. That will ideally have code implemented in it to allow for when you press the space bar all the colors in the given display will invert.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome for me will be code that shows a display of some color. That uses a turtle to draw a drawing of any kind. That will show digital rain how the teacher taught us with small changes. When the space bar is pressed it will remove the digital rain or turtle drawing.
## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Figuring out what I want my turtle drawing to be.
  2. Finish writing the code to make the turtle drawing.

- Week 2
  1. Write the code for the digital rain
  2. Customize the digital rain

- Week N (Final)
  1. Figure out and start coding for my inverting color function
  2. Finish coding inverting color function.
