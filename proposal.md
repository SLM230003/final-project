# Title
Inverting Digital Rain Drawing
## Repository
<https://github.com/SLM230003/final-project.git>

## Description
I would like to create a code that is like our last lab which was a generated moving artwork. I plan to do something similar by using pygame to make a work of art, and perhaps including digital rain like in Lab C08.
## Features
- Feature 1
  - Code that uses pygame to make a design of my choosing
- Feature 2
  - code that makes the digital rain
- Feature N
  - code to invert the colors using the space bar

## Challenges
- I need to plan out my design because I already know that pygame draws stuff from the top left-hand corner down to the right bottom corner.
- maybe a more efficient way of making digital rain but if not, I will use the instructions our teacher gave us, but I will add custom changes to fit my liking.
- How to invert colors simultaneously in a given display so it looks uniform.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally, I will have a code that when run shows a display of a color of my choosing. That uses a pygame to make a drawing of my choosing. That simultaneously displays the custom digital rain of my choosing. That will ideally have code implemented in it to allow for when you press the space bar all the colors in the given display will invert.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome for me will be code that shows a display of some color. That uses a pygame to draw a drawing of any kind. That will show digital rain how the teacher taught us with small changes. When the space bar is pressed it will remove the digital rain or drawing.
## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Figuring out what I want my drawing to be.
  2. Finish writing the code to make the drawing.

- Week 2
  1. Write the code for the digital rain
  2. Customize the digital rain

- Week N (Final)
  1. Figure out and start coding for my inverting color function
  2. Finish coding inverting color function.
