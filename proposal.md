# Title
Inverting Digital Rain Drawing
## Repository
<https://github.com/SLM230003/final-project.git>

## Description
I would like to create a code that is like our last lab which was a generated moving artwork. I plan to do something similar by using pygame to make a work of art, and perhaps including digital rain like in Lab C08.
## Features
- Feature 1
  - Code that uses pygame to make a design of my choosing will fill a good portion of the display. I believe it will be executed by determining the cordinates on a given display.
- Feature 2
  - Code that makes the digital rain. It will be executed by creating a class for particle, particle trail, and the actual rain function.
- Feature N
  - Code to invert the colors using the space bar. I think it will be exectuted by creating a KEYDOWN function to the space bar, and attaching a built in color inversion function.

## Challenges
- I need to plan out my design because I already know that pygame draws stuff from the top left-hand corner down to the right bottom corner of the display. I will need to determine a way to navigate all the cordinates on the display.
- I will try to find a more efficient way of making digital rain but if not, I will use the instructions our teacher gave us, but I will add custom changes to fit my liking.
- I will research how to invert colors simultaneously in a given display so it looks uniform.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Ideally, I will have a code that when run shows a display of a color of my choosing. That uses a pygame to make a drawing of my choosing. That simultaneously displays the custom digital rain of my choosing. That will ideally have code implemented in it which allows for when you press the space bar all the colors in the given display will invert.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome for me will be code that shows a display of some color. That uses a pygame to draw a drawing of any kind. That will show digital rain how the teacher taught us with small changes. That will allow for when the space bar is pressed it will remove the digital rain or drawing.
## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Figuring out what I want my drawing to be.
  2. Finish writing the code to make the drawing.

- Week 2
  1. Write the code for the digital rain.
  2. Customize the digital rain.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Figure out and start coding for my inverting color function.
  2. Finish coding inverting color function.
  3. Put it all together.
