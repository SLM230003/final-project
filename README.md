## Description
Hello, this is the “Inverting Digital Rain Drawing”, my name is Sergio Mendoza, and my program is a pygame digital art that displays my very own custom digital drawing via code that solves for coordinate points, code that allows for the effect of digital rain, and a surprise space bar function.
For my first three functions, I have my “Particle Class”, “Particle Trail Class”, and “Rain Class” which come together to create the functionality of my digital rain effect. I modified my “Particle Class” so that instead of displaying boring squares it displays random upper and lowercase letters in randomly generated colors. For my fourth function, I added a space bar functionality which allows me to switch between two different sets of code. My fifth function is code which figures out where all the coordinates for the drawing need to be. This itself has three different functions first is to create the inner and outer circles, the second one calculates the coordinates for the vertices of the triangle, and the third calculates the coordinates for the vertices of the square. My sixth function is code which utilizes the the space bar function I created earlier to replace the drawing with a version of the drawing that has a randomly generated color strobe effect. You can make the function true or false by pressing the space bar.
As far as future areas of improvement I am not sure where to start I don't fully grasp Python and how it all works so this project was the absolute best of my ability, but my hope for the future is to become an expert in Python and other coding languages. So my next steps would be to start studying alone so I can start to grasp the field. I plan to have fun with Python and do as much as I can in order to make my life easier.
